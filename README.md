# Sentiment-Trading-Bots
A variety of stock/cryptocurrency trading bots that use NLP and Sentiment analysis to make orders
Only the reddit and twitter bots have been uploaded so far.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

```
pip install python-binance praw textblob tensorflow ta ernie torch
```

I reccommend using an anaconda environment with this, but naturally, these bots work with anything.

Additionally, should you be running this on a local device, I recommend having a CUDA enabled GPU and
all the relevant CUDA and cudnn files installed. It <i>will</i> run on a CPU, but not as fast

I will not take any responsibility for any profits/losses incurred by any third party using these bots
